Food AI Recognition and Calorie Estimator


This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to identify the type of food in an image, list its ingredients, and estimate its caloric content.

This tool can be useful in various applications including diet tracking, health apps, and educative purposes to better understand the nutritional content of different food types.

Features
Detects the type of food in an image using a trained Machine Learning model.
Identifies possible ingredients in the food.
Estimates the caloric content of the detected food.
